### Our Ads

Our ads are HTML/CSS. They may contain graphic images (including animated GIFs) but not Flash/PHP.

Every time an ad on our network is seen, we profile the user who saw that ad. In the data there could be the IP address and all the data associated with it but we will never know your real name, home address, e-mail address etc...

We could use Linkly-type profiling mechanisms (url shortener). We use Google Analytics.

We also rely on another advertising network, A-ADS, the A-ADS privacy policy can be found [here](https://a-ads.com/privacy_policy).
